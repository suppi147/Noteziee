## Introduction

Noteziee is a web application for noting down texts, with fast login mechanism and friendly noting interface, Noteziee can help you remember everything.

## Features

- **We help you remember everything**, in a way that notes are displayed with 3 blocks in a row with fully interactive functionalities that are: post, delete, multi-select, edit, and show details for big notes.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL 8.0.32
- Apache 2.4.52
